# xlsx-to-twmap
Did you ever want to use Microsoft Excel as map editor for teeworlds? No? Well, now you can do it anyway.

Just put the entity number you want into the cells of the Template.xlsx, save the file and pass it as argument to this tool.

You don't need to use the template, but it is already pre-configured to automatically color the following entity numbers:
- 1, hookable, brown
- 9, freeze, grey
- 192, spawn, turquoise
- 33, start, yellow
- 34, finish, green
